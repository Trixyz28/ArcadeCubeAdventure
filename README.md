# Arcade Cube Adventure


**Arcade Cube Adventure** is a mini 3D video game implemented with **Vulkan**.

The game sets up an arcade-style playroom with various furniture and game machines, and the user can control a cube to explore around and to collect rewards through moving and jumping.

## Game Controls

- <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> to move towards the four directions with respect to the cube's current orientation.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> to jump.
- <kbd>&#8592;</kbd>, <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to rotate the cube.
- <kbd>&#8593;</kbd>, <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to modify the height of the camera.
- <kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd> to move the camera closer to or farther from the cube. 
- <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd> to turn on or off the 4 different light sources. 



## Build & Deployment
Running the application requires the use of the 3D graphics API Vulkan, with the libraries GLFW and GLM. The setup tutorial can be found [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment).
We have relied on Visual Studio for implementation and deployment. 


## Credits
The initial template of the project and many 3D models are taken from the resources provided by the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico di Milano.
